# Risk-Uncertainty-and-Financial-Markets
Recent experiences in asset market pricing are deviating from what is standard, in regard to the relationship between return and risk.  This analysis examines the role of uncertainty.  Uncertainty is differentiated from risk in several key dimensions and is hypothesized to have differential effects on market participant behavior. These effects are difficult to ascertain because uncertainty by definition is unmeasurable. One attempt to measure uncertainty is using the VIX and VVIX. Using a VAR I analyze the relationship between SPY, VIX, and VVIX from 2007-2022.

# Risk-Uncertainty-and-Financial-Markets
Recent experiences in asset market pricing are anomalous in regard to the relationship between return and risk.  This paper examines a potential missing ingredient that may help clarify the relationship between risk and returnâ€”that is, the role of uncertainty.  Uncertainty is differentiated from risk in several key dimensions and is hypothesized to have differential effects on market participant behavior.  These effects are difficult to ascertain because uncertainty by definition is unmeasurable.  Several indirect methods of measurement, or proxies, of uncertainty are proposed in this paper.  Empirical tests are run to confirm the relationships between risk, uncertainty, and asset market prices. The results are used to develop a model of portfolio risk management incorporating uncertainty.
